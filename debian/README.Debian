liblzf CMake Targets and Embedding the library
==============================================

The debianized version of liblzf exports two CMake targets, which can be
imported with `find_package(liblzf)`:

    liblzf::liblzf  --  link against the shared library
    liblzf::embed   --  embed the lzf library in your own executable

The latter target avoids the public shared object dependency and is the
preferred way to use the library according to the upstream author. However, you
need to re-compile your project to update the library, e.g. in case of security
vulnerabilities. You should carefully consider which option suits your project
best.

The CMake configuration also sets liblzf_INCLUDE_DIRS and liblzf_SOURCES to
the include path and the library source files, respectively.
