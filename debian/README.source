I replaced the autoconf build system with CMake; the relevant files can be
found in debian/extras and will be copied into the source tree by debian/rules
right before package configuration occurs.

The source distribution is signed with OpenBSD signify. The public key can be
found in debian/signing-key.pub. Unfortunately, uscan cannot automatically
verify this type of signature (yet).


III.

The ABI of this library is very simple and thus very stable, basically unchanged since
the very first release. However, the internal compression has evolved a bit, thus I
am conservative and declare the library symbols compatible back to version 1.5 at most.
Incidentally, this is when the new LZF_VERSION macro was added to lzf.h, and its 
value remained unchanged since.
